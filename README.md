# Stock-Analysis
# Overview of Project
# Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to take what we learned in module 2 and refine the code to make it more effecient.  This is called refactoring the code, to show our results we have take screen shots of the time it takes to process the analysis.  

# Results 

Using the Stock data we initially went through the module and used for loop and nested for loops to go through the entire data set each time and just added up the values for the results.  When we refactored we were able to reduce the process time of the analysis with the use of arrays.  In the refactored code we were able to set up one index that was being used by the four arrays.  We reduce the amounts of time need to do the analysis by reducing the number of itirations by using arrays.


## Summary
 -  Advantage of refacoctoring is to reduce processing time and simplify code which will make it easier for other to work with and debug code in the future.  Disadvantages refactoring code can often time be more complex and harder to understand.  Also it takes more time depending on the scope and complexity of your project you may just choose to do the quick and easy code instead of taking the time to simplify it and make it the most effecient 
-  Advantage of the original code is less time consuming and easier to flow.  Advantages of the refactored code is that it takes less processing time, and able to handle larger data sets .  Disadvantages of the original is that it is not good for large data sets like the whole stock market stack is not optimized.  Disadvantage of refactored that it takes longer time to write and must have more advanced understanding of material.
